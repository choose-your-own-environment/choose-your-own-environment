     August 1st, 1800. Another hazy morning in North Philadelphia.
     There's a rap on your front door.
     A courier hands you a large envelope, then speeds off without a word.
     It’s from your uncle. There’s two pieces of mail inside - a letter, and a deed.
     “To my only relative\: Please use this wisely. I don’t have anyone interested in the property right now, but it’s worth at least $200 an acre. It’s mostly forested too, so it’s even more valuable with timber accounted for. Make yourself a bundle, or take a long walk through the woods - it’s up to you.”
     The other piece of mail is a deed for… 5,000 acres! You do the math, and feel your heart skip a beat. You’re a millionaire!
     You feel a ginger tap on your shoulder.
 - prompt: Turn around...?
 - leftcharacter: “Hello. I’m Professor Montgomery. I’d like to buy you a drink, as way of congratulations on your new fortune.”
